                    the
                    Committee ("Whistleblower Protection"):</li>
                <ol class="moredesc2" type="a">
                    <li>protection of confidential information unless disclosure is required by law;</li>
                    <li>immunity from civil and disciplinary action by the Company; and</li>
                    <li>protection against Detrimental Actions.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>The Company shall revoke the Whistleblower Protection if it is of the opinion, based on the
                    Committee's
                    investigation, that:</li>
                <ol class="moredesc" type="a">
                    <li>the Whistleblower wilfully made a false Report</li>
                    <li>immunity from civil and disciplinary action by the Company; and</li>
                    <li>the disclosure of the Reportable Conduct is frivolous or vexatious;</li>
                    <li>the disclosure of the Reportable Conduct principally involves questioning the merits of Company
                        policy;</li>
                    <li>the disclosure of the Reportable Conduct is made solely or substantially with the motive of
                        avoiding
                        dismissal or other disciplinary action; or</li>
                    <li>the Whistleblower, in the course of making the disclosure of providing further information,
                        fails to
                        comply with paragraph 4.2 of this Policy.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Any revocation of the Whistleblower Protection shall be notified to the Whistleblower.</li>

            <li>Dealing with Reports</li>
            <ol class="moredesc">
                <li>All Reports are to be dealt with by the IA who shall prepare a report for the Olen Cinemas Board.
                    All
                    Reports should be investigated within a reasonable time but not later than 2 months from the date of
                    receipt of such reports, unless extended by the Olen Cinemas Board.</li>
                <li>If the investigation reveals that any complaint made under this Policy constitutes a disciplinary or
                    criminal offence, the Company will be entitled to:</li>
                <ol class="moredesc2" type="a">
                    <li>in the case of a disciplinary offence, take the appropriate disciplinary action (including
                        immediate
                        dismissal); or</li>
                    <li>in the case of a criminal offence, take such steps as it deems appropriate (including but not
                        limited to making a police report), against the person who has committed the relevant offence.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </ol><br><br>
            <li>False Reports <br>
                It is very important that a Whistleblower who makes a Report does so in good faith and with reasonable
                grounds for suspecting that a Reportable Conduct or a Detrimental Action, as the case may be, has
                occurred.
                The Company takes all Reports made under this Policy very seriously and if a Whistleblower makes a false
                Report maliciously or recklessly, with an ulterior motive, or for personal gain, the Company reserves
                the
                right to take appropriate disciplinary action against that Whistleblower, including termination of
                service
                or employment.
